# Express Server BMI Calculator

## Project Description

Throughout my professional career, my focus has primarily been on frontend libraries and frameworks such as React. However, with an eye toward the future, I desired to expand my skillset and enhance my backend knowledge by delving deeper into node and express. To achieve this, I embarked on a project to develop a straightforward BMI calculator utilizing express and javascript.

During the course of this project, I encountered challenges that were similar to those I had faced previously, including navigating the intricacies of get and post requests. This experience underscored for me the importance of consistently applying one's knowledge as a developer, as failure to do so can result in forgetting critical pieces of information. Fortunately, given express's widespread usage, I was able to rely on the platform's extensive documentation to overcome these obstacles.

While the project was primarily intended as an exercise in honing my skills, it served its purpose admirably. Although I have no plans to further develop this particular project in the future, I will carry the lessons I learned forward into future endeavors.
